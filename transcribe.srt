1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,486
Last time Gordon Ramsey makes a spy. Rice so good.

2
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,882
Uncle Roger called him Uncle Gordon. This time he

3
00:00:06,896 --> 00:00:10,458
begged me. King Ramen. Can he keep his uncle title, or is

4
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:13,340
he going to lose it? Let's see. Let's see.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,914
Halloween and nephew new neon sign. Uncle Roger Rice

6
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:21,658
cooker. What do you think? What you think? Leave comment. Let Uncle

7
00:00:21,694 --> 00:00:25,820
Roger know what you think of my neon light underneath the neon light.

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,210
Wait, before we even start, why Gordon looks so shiny.

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,602
What is this, medium to saw bullshit? Right? Come on.

10
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:38,482
Let's be honest, ramen, is that comfort food that we all love, especially on a

11
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,938
cold day? But today, trust me, I'm going to show you how to elevate that

12
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:45,406
notoriously cheap dish into something delicious. And guess what?

13
00:00:45,528 --> 00:00:51,418
Give me a V. That's right. Vegetarian. Right. What making

14
00:00:51,564 --> 00:00:55,802
vegetarian food? Cotton. I thought you hate vegetarian.

15
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:59,018
I'm allergic to vegetarians. I come out in a rash.

16
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:01,886
Why you make vegetarian food now? Garden.

17
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:05,494
Why you bow down to those people? What's the point of having

18
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:08,914
all those knives back there if you're vegetarian? Were you gonna

19
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:12,682
use the clever for Pok Choy? Um, and guess what?

20
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:16,478
Give me a V. But give me a we is actually good pickup

21
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:19,918
line. He's a nephew. Go to bar, find woman you like, and tell

22
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:23,002
her to give you a wee. Sorry, children.

23
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:27,010
Right. Come in, Oscar. Let me show you the ingredients. Egg noodles.

24
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,030
Egg noodle, uncle Gordon already made

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,574
mistake. Egg noodle. Raw noodles. Ramen should use wheat

26
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:38,146
alkaline noodles. That's not starting well. Three and

27
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:41,978
a half minutes. Beautiful. Seaweed scallion. Seaweed good scallion tofu

28
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:45,466
correct. Ginger. Good cauliflower. These are

29
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:48,914
the secret ingredients. These are cauliflower, uh, dried shiitake

30
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:52,090
mushrooms. They're going to go in good. And they're going to rehydrate.

31
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,566
Right. Let's have ten minutes on the clock. Wait. Ramen take at least

32
00:01:56,628 --> 00:02:00,398
10 hours. He's making in ten minutes. I don't

33
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:03,898
think this is going to go well. Keep watching. See if Uncle Roger correct.

34
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:06,670
Get them with a spoon and drop them into that water. Okay?

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,490
Please tell me six minutes. Six minutes.

36
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,902
Correct. Bring it up to the boil. Boil them gently, and I want to ball

37
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:16,114
that. Put a little bit of sort of yolky bit in the middle. Good.

38
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:19,894
Software immediately. Okay. In mushroom in

39
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,500
water. Sort of go up a level.

40
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,454
Okay. I hope he making Tara and not just working everything

41
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:30,742
in pan. Turn, uh, the gas up.

42
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:33,706
Okay. And now we're going to start creating that base.

43
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:37,898
First off, a tablespoon of Meat's paste.

44
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:41,270
No, don't put miso

45
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,954
paste in your boiling water. It's going to kill the miso.

46
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:47,834
You want to make miso? Make misotari separately.

47
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:52,030
Hi. This, uh, is the same mistake Nigel I lost on making her ramen.

48
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,422
Gordon, you make me so sad. Okay, and give

49
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:59,760
that a really good mix. Now, those mushrooms are doubling in size.

50
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,590
Doubling in size. Just like Aunty Herald after our marriage.

51
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,686
And the exciting thing now is that it starts and give flavor.

52
00:03:06,758 --> 00:03:10,138
That water. Wait, just one tablespoon miso in

53
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:13,294
that big pot water. What's the

54
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:16,834
point? Not going to taste like anything. This just Husky hit

55
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:20,338
of miso. That not enough. A Husky hit of miso from

56
00:03:20,364 --> 00:03:24,130
there. Tablespoon of soy.

57
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,260
Now you're just working random shit in boiling water.

58
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,242
Touch a mirror because it gives it a little bit of lift and a bit

59
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:36,338
of a bite. One of my favorites, takarashi spice. Beautiful Japanese

60
00:03:36,374 --> 00:03:39,734
pepper in lightly seasoning

61
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:43,178
with the chili flakes. White chili flakes and Takarushi

62
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:46,906
pepper. Same thing. You're wasting money and wasting time.

63
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:50,566
Get your egg noodles in and then.

64
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:54,550
No, don't put your egg noodle

65
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,066
wrong. Noodle. First of all. And don't put your noodle

66
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,866
in the broth. You should Cook separately. The broth needs

67
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:06,718
time to extract flavor out of ingredients. You put no

68
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:10,154
doubt in broth for that long, it's going to be Socky and dead

69
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:13,080
in the anxiety. Caught, uh uh,

70
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:16,894
on every step. Wrong so far. What happening?

71
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:20,110
What's happening? The gas. Okay,

72
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,446
that's right. Turn off the gas. Now give that a

73
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:27,658
good mix. Taste that broth white

74
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:31,574
taste for what? Shit in water for two minutes. Where could taste?

75
00:04:31,622 --> 00:04:35,314
You're just tasting soy sauce and water. Two minutes. Not long enough for

76
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:38,798
anything. Trust me. Uncle Roger know. Delicious.

77
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:42,718
Plus more salt. Okay, for me. And then a little

78
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:45,722
bit of salt and look, the seaweed.

79
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:48,660
Seaweed. Now I just cut off. No.

80
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,646
What's, uh, he doing? What's he doing? Oh my God.

81
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:58,450
Seaweed into boiling water. What are you doing?

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,062
Garden seaweed broth. I'm just

83
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:04,380
going to disintegrate into the water.

84
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,306
You killing me, Gordon. And you're killing the seaweed.

85
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:11,880
Uncle Roger have to put my leg down from chair already.

86
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,478
Gordon, you fucked up. See, we supposed to go in

87
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:18,850
ramen last thing right before you eat. Like go watch

88
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,150
Uncle Roger make ramen with Joe. See how it done. Nice.

89
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,180
Long. Sort of almost strip. Like Juliet. No.

90
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,702
Uh, every minute this broth is getting better,

91
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:32,218
tastier and deeper. It's getting wrong. Good.

92
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:35,760
Is that what it gets? Vegetables and then just taste again.

93
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,640
Good. Now it's nearly there. Nearly. Uh, where? Hell, that where

94
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,670
tofu. Just literally

95
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,718
tofu. Okay, because vegetarian beautiful strands.

96
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:53,626
Not my first choice, but okay, I just place that on top. Wait.

97
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:57,950
Tofu. Straight into what in vegetarian ramen

98
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,438
tofu replace the pork belly. So you need to marinate the

99
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:04,658
tofu first. Don't just serve raw tofu.

100
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:08,410
It just tastes like bean marinade.

101
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,102
Oscar, please come down. Have a quick look at

102
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:16,946
the smorgasbord of delicious ingredients that look just like miso soup.

103
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:20,218
Where co ramen don't look like ramen at all. If your ramen look

104
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:23,530
like miso soup, you fucked up delicious ingredients,

105
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,198
man. That's good. That's so good, man. That's good.

106
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:32,870
He kept tasting and he keep lying. Take your

107
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,690
cephal oil and just sesame oil.

108
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,782
I think, uh, that's going to be the only aroma oil he used.

109
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,554
Sure. The gas is off. I want to touch more spice

110
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:46,770
in there for me. Just a touch. Let it simmer

111
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,790
the gap. This ramen

112
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,878
is not jazz. You don't just implement passes off.

113
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:58,298
Okay? Eggs are boiling time, please.

114
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:02,140
Right. Three minutes down. Cauliflower. Cauliflower. Now,

115
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,734
this gives a bit of texture for ramen. It's a great way,

116
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:10,818
I guess, for vegetarian ramen flower. Okay, these bits

117
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:14,438
here, just cut around there. Slice those bits nice and

118
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:17,510
thin. And these stalks are so delicious.

119
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,342
Stock. Delicious. Stock is worst part of vegetable.

120
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,750
Um, Uncle Roger don't, um, like vegetable. Vegetables tastes like sad.

121
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,674
But if Uncle Roger has to eat vegetable, I eat the leaf,

122
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,938
because stock tastes as shit. As leaf, but harder

123
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:36,002
to chew. Stock is the same shit food, but more effort. Who want that?

124
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:40,818
Okay. Like the storks on a broccoli. Beautiful ramen.

125
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:44,922
And put those stalks in there. Uh, take your cauliflower.

126
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:48,230
He's still going on about cauliflower.

127
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,834
Lightly season it does that with, uh, some rice flour.

128
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:55,238
Crunch cauliflower. So when we frock on

129
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:59,042
some chili in there. So I got some heat. Okay? And then look

130
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:02,200
a nice little shallow, fly hot pan. Uh,

131
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,342
get the oil in. Nice, crispy texture that sits

132
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,330
on top of those noodles.

133
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,374
Is this ramen weejo, or is this cauliflower?

134
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:18,150
With sight of chicken noodleujo. He spent 30 seconds making

135
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,690
ramen broth and 3 hours making cauliflower.

136
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,178
All this, uh, time. Meanwhile, the noodle in that pot

137
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:30,082
just drowning again. I love frying

138
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:33,138
a nonstick pan because I get that texture. I really get it nice and soft.

139
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:37,470
Nonstick. You just say nonstick, and then you use metal spoon.

140
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,630
Cannot use metal spoon in nonstick garden.

141
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,486
Uh, why like this? Uh,

142
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:50,038
today? What's wrong with you? It looked like you came out

143
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:53,760
about getting your shirt to match the cabinet. They're making good food,

144
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,950
but look. Look at the color of that cauliflower.

145
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,174
Beautiful. Now it's going Golden Brown. Can we

146
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:04,630
go back to ramen now, please? I want a little slice

147
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,800
of kitchen towel. Get that ready.

148
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,490
Uh, colander and cauliflower together this week.

149
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,258
Have all of Uncle Roger nightmare. I think it's really nice

150
00:09:16,284 --> 00:09:19,740
and crispy. I've got a chili in there as well.

151
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,894
My mom going to go beat you up. Gordon, scrape, uh,

152
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:27,490
scrape. Scrape with metal spoon. Some wonderful

153
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,990
spring onion. Okay, spring onion. Good. Finally, we done with cauliflower

154
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,978
on the bias, so I go sideway this time.

155
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:38,220
Sideway. Uncle Roger likes sideways also,

156
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,526
and the sort of white parts. Again, I'm just going to sprinkle in.

157
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:46,318
Oh, you sprinkle into broth. Spring onion and

158
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:49,942
ramen broth. Okay, but you're not going to have enough time

159
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:53,866
to get the flavor out. Ten minutes. One more final

160
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:57,514
taste. Look at it in there.

161
00:09:57,672 --> 00:09:59,760
Oscar, come in, come in. Pan down.

162
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,934
Don't tell Oscar to pan down. Uncle Roger want

163
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:06,790
you to put your pan down. Stop cooking.

164
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,318
That is so delicious. Now, eggs.

165
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:14,582
Take them out. I always like to sort of put them into cold waterfall.

166
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:17,758
Ok, correct. Egg and ice bath. Correct. Right.

167
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:21,086
Time to serve. Get your, uh, bowl. This is a very generous

168
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:24,545
sort of family style dish. Family style.

169
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:28,178
Um, high. But they eat ramen family style.

170
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:31,090
Wrong bowl. Okay. Big,

171
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,642
deep, beautiful dish now.

172
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:37,320
Oh, look at it. Oh, my God.

173
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,520
The flavor don't look good.

174
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,990
That ramen looks so dead and lifeless.

175
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,586
90 seconds where I forget this. Look. It's so

176
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:55,838
weird serving in this la Crusi sauce panhai.

177
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:59,378
Gordon, just buy ramen bowl. You cannot afford ramen

178
00:10:59,414 --> 00:11:02,842
bowl, is it? Your daughter on Strictly Come Dancing? Ask her to lend you

179
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:06,166
some money. Buy some ramen Bowl Tilly, help your old guy out.

180
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:10,346
Go pick up ginger mascallions, spring onions,

181
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:13,942
and then look this beautiful, nice,

182
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:18,038
crispy cauliflower on top. I think this Witcher

183
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:21,766
Gordon, sponsored by cauliflower company. He spent so much time

184
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:25,306
talking about it. Now with the egg tap, tap, tap, pull.

185
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:27,300
And then just put in your top of your hand.

186
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,306
Don't blow. You're giving everybody a cold

187
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:35,990
with don't blow egg.

188
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,394
And that from there. Literally should come off

189
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:44,138
super quick. Okay, the Ed peeling quite popular. May I

190
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:47,730
give you that runny yoke

191
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,194
and then look. Yoke. Correct. It looked good, but you need to

192
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:54,794
marinate your egg. Gordon, look at this egg. It's, uh, whiter than

193
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:59,178
Jamie Oliver. Who wants to eat just from there? Just literally

194
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:03,090
snip snip. That is not fresh. Cilantro. Coriander.

195
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:10,342
No coriander

196
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:14,338
on ramen. Just because

197
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:18,122
a dish Asian doesn't mean you can just put coriander

198
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:21,890
on it. Some ramen. Chefs put coriander or cilantro

199
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,498
in ramen, but not like that. It doesn't matter what country you're in. It's all

200
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:27,900
delicious. And there we are.

201
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,694
What's this? Uncle Roger can't watch anymore. The broth

202
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:39,342
all wrong. No Tari, barely any aroma oil.

203
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,675
Wrong type of noodle. I know this,

204
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:46,262
uh, is supposed to be quick. Ten minute ramen. But if you want ramen in

205
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:49,514
ten minutes, just make instant ramen even that better than

206
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:52,778
this. Or go to ramen restaurant. Get ramen in ten minutes.

207
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:56,322
Easy. Gordon, your egg spirit rice so good. Why are ramen

208
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:59,694
so bad? Uncle Roger cannot call you Uncle Gordon anymore.

209
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:03,278
I need to take back that title. Gordon, you're supposed to be one

210
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:10,242
of the good ones. Why you join dark site to

211
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,266
all of you. Thank you for watching Ramsay Intent. If I went too quick.

212
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:16,686
Oh, he changed shirt. Slow it down. Now don't forget to

213
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:20,614
pick up Ramsey. Uh, Intent cookbook inspired. Buy this. He got cookbook.

214
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:23,790
Trust me. You want to come out of much better chef. It's going to teach

215
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,238
all wrong recipes. Is it? Why are you going to use that cleaner

216
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,770
for Bok Choy?

217
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,450
Uncle, you have to change color. I too upset.

218
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,610
Good. Now it's nearly there. Nearly where?

219
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,400
Hell. That way.

220
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,570
By the way, Uncle Roger noticed what is white people obsession

221
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,230
with making food fast? Like this one?

222
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,530
Ramen in ten minutes. Or Jamie olive oil. Cookbook, like,

223
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,098
five ingredients. Just make it properly?

224
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:03,586
Teaching cooking in Asia, uncle Roger never see anyone go

225
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:07,406
oh I teach you how to make laksa in nine in it. No it's

226
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:08,080
not going to be good.
