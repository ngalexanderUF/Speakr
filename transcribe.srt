1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,486
Last time Gordon Ramsey makes a spy. Rice so good.

2
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,714
Uncle Roger called him Uncle Gordon. This time

3
00:00:06,752 --> 00:00:10,006
he begged me. King Ramen. Can he keep his uncle title,

4
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:13,340
or is he going to lose it? Let's see. Let's see.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,566
Halloween and nephew new neon sign. Uncle Roger

6
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:21,046
Rice cooker. What do you think? What you think? Leave comment.

7
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,634
Let Uncle Roger know what you think of my neon light underneath

8
00:00:24,682 --> 00:00:25,820
the neon light.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,210
Wait, before we even start, why Gordon looks so shiny.

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,850
What is this, medium to saw bullshit?

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,834
Right? Come on. Let's be honest, ramen, is that comfort food that we all love,

12
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:41,062
especially on a cold day? But today, trust me, I'm going to show you how

13
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:44,890
to elevate that notoriously cheap dish into something delicious. And guess

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,846
what? Give me a V. That's right. Vegetarian.

15
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:52,694
Right. What making vegetarian

16
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,582
food? Cotton. I thought you hate vegetarian. I'm allergic

17
00:00:56,606 --> 00:01:00,650
to vegetarians. I come out in a rash. Why you make vegetarian

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,558
food now? Garden. Why you bow down to those people? What's the

19
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:08,282
point of having all those knives back there if you're vegetarian?

20
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:12,682
Were you gonna use the clever for Pok Choy? Um, and guess what?

21
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:16,478
Give me a V. But give me a we is actually good pickup

22
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:19,918
line. He's a nephew. Go to bar, find woman you like, and tell

23
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:23,686
her to give you a wee. Sorry, children. Right.

24
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:27,010
Come in, Oscar. Let me show you the ingredients. Egg noodles.

25
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,550
Egg noodle, uncle Gordon already made mistake.

26
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,630
Egg noodle. Raw noodles. Ramen should use wheat alkaline noodles.

27
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,938
That's not starting well. Three and a half minutes.

28
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:42,322
Beautiful. Seaweed scallion. Seaweed good scallion tofu correct.

29
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:46,238
Ginger. Good cauliflower. These are the secret ingredients.

30
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:50,050
These are cauliflower, uh, dried shiitake mushrooms. They're going to go in

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,758
good. And they're going to rehydrate. Right. Let's have ten minutes

32
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:57,322
on the clock. Wait. Ramen take at least 10 hours.

33
00:01:57,396 --> 00:02:00,838
He's making in ten minutes. I don't think this

34
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:04,282
is going to go well. Keep watching. See if Uncle Roger correct. Get them

35
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:07,630
with a spoon and drop them into that water. Okay? Please tell me

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,306
six minutes. Six minutes. Correct. Bring it up to the boil.

37
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,122
Boil them gently, and I want to ball that. Put a little bit of sort

38
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:17,822
of yolky bit in the middle. Good. Software immediately.

39
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:21,658
Okay. In mushroom in water. Sort of go

40
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:25,598
up a level. Okay. I hope he making Tara

41
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:29,100
and not just working everything in pan. Turn, uh,

42
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,858
the gas up. Okay. And now we're going to start creating

43
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:34,920
that base. First off,

44
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,640
a tablespoon of Meat's paste. No,

45
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,462
don't put miso paste in your boiling water. It's going

46
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:47,150
to kill the miso. You want to make miso? Make misotari

47
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,618
separately. Hi. This, uh, is the same mistake Nigel I lost

48
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:54,250
on making her ramen. Gordon, you make

49
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,638
me so sad. Okay, and give that a really good mix.

50
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:01,114
Now, those mushrooms are doubling in size. Doubling in size.

51
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:04,738
Just like Aunty Herald after our marriage. And the exciting thing now

52
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:08,050
is that it starts and give flavor. That water. Wait,

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,640
just one tablespoon miso in that big pot water.

54
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,346
What's the point? Not going to taste like anything.

55
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:19,058
This just Husky hit of miso. That not enough. A Husky

56
00:03:19,094 --> 00:03:20,940
hit of miso from there.

57
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,918
Tablespoon of soy. Now you're just working

58
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:29,798
random shit in boiling water. Touch a mirror

59
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:33,050
because it gives it a little bit of lift and a bit of a bite.

60
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,620
One of my favorites, takarashi spice. Beautiful Japanese pepper in

61
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,038
lightly seasoning with the chili flakes. White chili

62
00:03:42,074 --> 00:03:45,610
flakes and Takarushi pepper. Same thing. You're wasting money

63
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,900
and wasting time. Get your egg noodles in

64
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,302
and then. No, don't put your

65
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:56,662
egg noodle wrong. Noodle. First of

66
00:03:56,676 --> 00:04:00,062
all. And don't put your noodle in the broth.

67
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:04,166
You should Cook separately. The broth needs time to extract

68
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:08,170
flavor out of ingredients. You put no doubt in broth for that long,

69
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,950
it's going to be Socky and dead in the anxiety.

70
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,420
Caught, uh uh, on every step. Wrong so far.

71
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,358
What happening? What's happening? The gas.

72
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:22,370
Okay, that's right. Turn off the gas.

73
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,530
Now give that a good mix. Taste that broth

74
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,250
white taste for what? Shit in water for two

75
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,670
minutes. Where could taste? You're just tasting soy sauce and water.

76
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,110
Two minutes. Not long enough for anything. Trust me. Uncle Roger know.

77
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,190
Delicious. Plus more salt. Okay, for me. And then

78
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,722
a little bit of salt and look, the seaweed.

79
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:48,660
Seaweed. Now I just cut off. No.

80
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,646
What's, uh, he doing? What's he doing? Oh my God.

81
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:58,450
Seaweed into boiling water. What are you doing?

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,062
Garden seaweed broth. I'm just

83
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:06,158
going to disintegrate into the water. You killing

84
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:09,958
me, Gordon. And you're killing the seaweed. Uncle Roger have to put my

85
00:05:09,984 --> 00:05:12,890
leg down from chair already. Gordon,

86
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,774
you fucked up. See, we supposed to go in ramen last thing

87
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:20,258
right before you eat. Like go watch Uncle Roger make ramen

88
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:23,618
with Joe. See how it done. Nice. Long. Sort of almost strip.

89
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:27,658
Like Juliet. No. Uh, every minute this broth is

90
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,914
getting better, tastier and deeper.

91
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:34,138
It's getting wrong. Good. Is that what it gets? Vegetables and

92
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:37,738
then just taste again. Good.

93
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:41,640
Now it's nearly there. Nearly. Uh, where? Hell, that where

94
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,670
tofu. Just literally

95
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,718
tofu. Okay, because vegetarian beautiful strands.

96
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:53,218
Not my first choice, but okay, I just place that on top.

97
00:05:53,304 --> 00:05:56,794
Wait. Tofu. Straight into what in

98
00:05:56,832 --> 00:06:00,322
vegetarian ramen tofu replace the pork belly. So you

99
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:03,854
need to marinate the tofu first. Don't just serve raw

100
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:08,410
tofu. It just tastes like bean marinade.

101
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,102
Oscar, please come down. Have a quick look at

102
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:16,502
the smorgasbord of delicious ingredients that look just like miso

103
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:19,702
soup. Where co ramen don't look like ramen at all. If your

104
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:23,530
ramen look like miso soup, you fucked up delicious ingredients,

105
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,306
man. That's good. That's so good, man. That's good. He kept tasting

106
00:06:30,378 --> 00:06:33,890
and he keep lying. Take your cephal oil and

107
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,154
just sesame oil. I think,

108
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,782
uh, that's going to be the only aroma oil he used.

109
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,554
Sure. The gas is off. I want to touch more spice

110
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:47,570
in there for me. Just a touch. Let it simmer the gap.

111
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,510
This ramen is not jazz. You don't just implement

112
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,710
passes off. Okay? Eggs are boiling time,

113
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,326
please. Right. Three minutes down. Cauliflower. Cauliflower.

114
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:05,214
Now, this gives a bit of texture for ramen.

115
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:09,270
It's a great way, I guess, for vegetarian ramen flower.

116
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,710
Okay, these bits here, just cut around

117
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,978
there. Slice those bits nice and thin. And these stalks

118
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:19,934
are so delicious. Stock. Delicious. Stock is

119
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:23,058
worst part of vegetable. Um, Uncle Roger don't, um, like vegetable.

120
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:27,078
Vegetables tastes like sad. But if Uncle Roger has to eat vegetable,

121
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:31,230
I eat the leaf, because stock tastes as shit. As leaf,

122
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,574
but harder to chew. Stock is the same shit food, but more

123
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:37,850
effort. Who want that? Okay. Like the storks on a

124
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,318
broccoli. Beautiful ramen. And put

125
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:44,922
those stalks in there. Uh, take your cauliflower.

126
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:48,230
He's still going on about cauliflower.

127
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,834
Lightly season it does that with, uh, some rice flour.

128
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:55,638
Crunch cauliflower. So when we frock on some chili

129
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:59,438
in there. So I got some heat. Okay? And then look a

130
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:03,098
nice little shallow, fly hot pan. Uh, get the

131
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:06,342
oil in. Nice, crispy texture that sits

132
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,330
on top of those noodles.

133
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,374
Is this ramen weejo, or is this cauliflower?

134
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:18,150
With sight of chicken noodleujo. He spent 30 seconds making

135
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,690
ramen broth and 3 hours making cauliflower.

136
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,286
All this, uh, time. Meanwhile, the noodle in that pot just drowning

137
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:30,622
again. I love frying a nonstick

138
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:33,658
pan because I get that texture. I really get it nice and soft. Nonstick.

139
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:37,470
You just say nonstick, and then you use metal spoon.

140
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,630
Cannot use metal spoon in nonstick garden.

141
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,486
Uh, why like this? Uh,

142
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:50,038
today? What's wrong with you? It looked like you came out

143
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:53,760
about getting your shirt to match the cabinet. They're making good food,

144
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,950
but look. Look at the color of that cauliflower.

145
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,594
Beautiful. Now it's going Golden Brown. Can we go back

146
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:05,878
to ramen now, please? I want a little slice of

147
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:09,325
kitchen towel. Get that ready. Uh,

148
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:13,934
colander and cauliflower together this week. Have all of Uncle

149
00:09:13,982 --> 00:09:17,290
Roger nightmare. I think it's really nice and crispy.

150
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,740
I've got a chili in there as well.

151
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,446
My mom going to go beat you up. Gordon, scrape, uh, scrape.

152
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:28,406
Scrape with metal spoon. Some wonderful spring

153
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:31,990
onion. Okay, spring onion. Good. Finally, we done with cauliflower

154
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,978
on the bias, so I go sideway this time.

155
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:38,220
Sideway. Uncle Roger likes sideways also,

156
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,526
and the sort of white parts. Again, I'm just going to sprinkle in.

157
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:46,094
Oh, you sprinkle into broth. Spring onion

158
00:09:46,142 --> 00:09:50,218
and ramen broth. Okay, but you're not going to have enough time to

159
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:53,866
get the flavor out. Ten minutes. One more final

160
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:57,514
taste. Look at it in there.

161
00:09:57,672 --> 00:10:01,270
Oscar, come in, come in. Pan down. Don't tell

162
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,474
Oscar to pan down. Uncle Roger want you to

163
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:06,790
put your pan down. Stop cooking.

164
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,818
That is so delicious. Now, eggs. Take them

165
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,830
out. I always like to sort of put them into cold waterfall. Ok,

166
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,418
correct. Egg and ice bath. Correct. Right. Time to

167
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:22,462
serve. Get your, uh, bowl. This is a very generous sort of family

168
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:26,158
style dish. Family style. Um, high. But they

169
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:29,450
eat ramen family style. Wrong bowl.

170
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,850
Okay. Big, deep, beautiful dish

171
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,320
now. Oh, look at it. Oh, my God.

172
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,520
The flavor don't look good.

173
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,990
That ramen looks so dead and lifeless.

174
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,266
90 seconds where I forget this.

175
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:54,314
Look. It's so weird serving in this la Crusi

176
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,550
sauce panhai. Gordon, just buy

177
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,154
ramen bowl. You cannot afford ramen bowl, is it? Your daughter on Strictly

178
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,514
Come Dancing? Ask her to lend you some money. Buy some ramen Bowl

179
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:09,074
Tilly, help your old guy out. Go pick up ginger mascallions,

180
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:12,540
spring onions, and then look this beautiful,

181
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,738
nice, crispy cauliflower on top.

182
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,374
I think this Witcher Gordon, sponsored by cauliflower company.

183
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,002
He spent so much time talking about it. Now with the egg tap, tap,

184
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:27,300
tap, pull. And then just put in your top of your hand.

185
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,306
Don't blow. You're giving everybody a cold

186
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:37,118
with don't blow egg. And that

187
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:41,222
from there. Literally should come off super quick.

188
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:46,998
Okay, the Ed peeling quite popular. May I give you that runny

189
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:50,066
yoke and then look. Yoke. Correct. It looked good,

190
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:53,970
but you need to marinate your egg. Gordon, look at this egg.

191
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,338
It's, uh, whiter than Jamie Oliver. Who wants to eat just from

192
00:11:57,364 --> 00:12:00,474
there? Just literally snip snip.

193
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:10,342
That is not fresh. Cilantro. Coriander. No coriander

194
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:11,430
on ramen.

195
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,122
Just because a dish Asian doesn't mean you can just put coriander

196
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:22,610
on it. Some ramen. Chefs put coriander or cilantro in ramen,

197
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,290
but not like that. It doesn't matter what country you're in. It's all delicious.

198
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,900
And there we are.

199
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,694
What's this? Uncle Roger can't watch anymore. The broth

200
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:39,342
all wrong. No Tari, barely any aroma oil.

201
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,758
Wrong type of noodle. I know this, uh,

202
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:46,454
is supposed to be quick. Ten minute ramen. But if you want ramen in ten

203
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:49,898
minutes, just make instant ramen even that better than this.

204
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:53,366
Or go to ramen restaurant. Get ramen in ten minutes. Easy.

205
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:56,918
Gordon, your egg spirit rice so good. Why are ramen so bad?

206
00:12:57,004 --> 00:13:00,254
Uncle Roger cannot call you Uncle Gordon anymore. I need to

207
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:04,334
take back that title. Gordon, you're supposed to be one of the good ones.

208
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:10,242
Why you join dark site to

209
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,266
all of you. Thank you for watching Ramsay Intent. If I went too quick.

210
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:16,402
Oh, he changed shirt. Slow it down. Now don't

211
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:20,614
forget to pick up Ramsey. Uh, Intent cookbook inspired. Buy this. He got cookbook.

212
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:23,790
Trust me. You want to come out of much better chef. It's going to teach

213
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,238
all wrong recipes. Is it? Why are you going to use that cleaner

214
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,770
for Bok Choy?

215
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,450
Uncle, you have to change color. I too upset.

216
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,610
Good. Now it's nearly there. Nearly where?

217
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,400
Hell. That way.

218
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,798
By the way, Uncle Roger noticed what is white people

219
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:53,230
obsession with making food fast? Like this one?

220
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,850
Ramen in ten minutes. Or Jamie olive oil. Cookbook, like, five ingredients.

221
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,526
Just make it properly? Teaching cooking in Asia,

222
00:14:01,598 --> 00:14:05,666
uncle Roger never see anyone go oh I teach you how to make laksa

223
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:08,080
in nine in it. No it's not going to be good.
