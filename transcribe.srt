1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,486
Last time Gordon Ramsey makes a spy. Rice so good.

2
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,882
Uncle Roger called him Uncle Gordon. This time he

3
00:00:06,896 --> 00:00:10,458
begged me. King Ramen. Can he keep his uncle title, or is

4
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:13,340
he going to lose it? Let's see. Let's see.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,566
Halloween and nephew new neon sign. Uncle Roger

6
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:21,046
Rice cooker. What do you think? What you think? Leave comment.

7
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,634
Let Uncle Roger know what you think of my neon light underneath

8
00:00:24,682 --> 00:00:25,820
the neon light.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,210
Wait, before we even start, why Gordon looks so shiny.

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,842
What is this, medium to saw bullshit? Right? Come on. Let's be

11
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:39,106
honest, ramen, is that comfort food that we all love, especially on a cold day?

12
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:42,482
But today, trust me, I'm going to show you how to elevate that notoriously

13
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:46,042
cheap dish into something delicious. And guess what? Give me a

14
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:48,490
V. That's right. Vegetarian. Right.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,694
What making vegetarian

16
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,582
food? Cotton. I thought you hate vegetarian. I'm allergic

17
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:59,974
to vegetarians. I come out in a rash. Why you make

18
00:01:00,012 --> 00:01:03,946
vegetarian food now? Garden. Why you bow down to those people?

19
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:07,378
What's the point of having all those knives back there if

20
00:01:07,404 --> 00:01:11,306
you're vegetarian? Were you gonna use the clever for Pok Choy?

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,046
Um, and guess what? Give me a V. But give me a we

22
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:19,058
is actually good pickup line. He's a nephew. Go to bar, find woman

23
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:22,450
you like, and tell her to give you a wee. Sorry,

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,838
children. Right. Come in, Oscar. Let me show you the ingredients.

25
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:28,630
Egg noodles. Egg noodle,

26
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,278
uncle Gordon already made mistake. Egg noodle. Raw noodles.

27
00:01:33,374 --> 00:01:37,260
Ramen should use wheat alkaline noodles. That's not starting well.

28
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,966
Three and a half minutes. Beautiful. Seaweed scallion. Seaweed good

29
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:44,170
scallion tofu correct. Ginger. Good cauliflower.

30
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,914
These are the secret ingredients. These are cauliflower, uh, dried shiitake

31
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:52,090
mushrooms. They're going to go in good. And they're going to rehydrate.

32
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,354
Right. Let's have ten minutes on the clock. Wait.

33
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:59,100
Ramen take at least 10 hours. He's making in ten minutes.

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,470
I don't think this is going to go well. Keep watching. See if Uncle Roger

35
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,938
correct. Get them with a spoon and drop them into that water.

36
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:08,602
Okay? Please tell me six minutes.

37
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,622
Six minutes. Correct. Bring it up to the boil. Boil them gently, and I want

38
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:15,586
to ball that. Put a little bit of sort of yolky bit in the middle.

39
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:19,610
Good. Software immediately. Okay. In mushroom

40
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,500
in water. Sort of go up a level.

41
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,410
Okay. I hope he making Tara and not just

42
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,100
working everything in pan. Turn, uh,

43
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,706
the gas up. Okay. And now we're going to start creating that base.

44
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:37,898
First off, a tablespoon of Meat's paste.

45
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:41,738
No, don't put miso paste

46
00:02:41,774 --> 00:02:45,562
in your boiling water. It's going to kill the miso. You want to

47
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:49,069
make miso? Make misotari separately. Hi. This,

48
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,030
uh, is the same mistake Nigel I lost on making her ramen.

49
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,818
Gordon, you make me so sad. Okay, and give that a really

50
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,760
good mix. Now, those mushrooms are doubling in size.

51
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,590
Doubling in size. Just like Aunty Herald after our marriage.

52
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,450
And the exciting thing now is that it starts and give flavor. That water.

53
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,654
Wait, just one tablespoon miso in that big

54
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:14,302
pot water. What's the point? Not going to

55
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:17,914
taste like anything. This just Husky hit of miso. That not

56
00:03:17,952 --> 00:03:20,940
enough. A Husky hit of miso from there.

57
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,918
Tablespoon of soy. Now you're just working

58
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:29,798
random shit in boiling water. Touch a mirror

59
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:33,050
because it gives it a little bit of lift and a bit of a bite.

60
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,620
One of my favorites, takarashi spice. Beautiful Japanese pepper in

61
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,386
lightly seasoning with the chili flakes. White chili flakes

62
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:46,322
and Takarushi pepper. Same thing. You're wasting money and wasting

63
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:50,074
time. Get your egg noodles in and

64
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:53,302
then. No, don't put your

65
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:56,258
egg noodle wrong. Noodle.

66
00:03:56,294 --> 00:04:00,062
First of all. And don't put your noodle in the broth.

67
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:04,166
You should Cook separately. The broth needs time to extract

68
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:07,894
flavor out of ingredients. You put no doubt in broth for that

69
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,950
long, it's going to be Socky and dead in the anxiety.

70
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,420
Caught, uh uh, on every step. Wrong so far.

71
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,358
What happening? What's happening? The gas.

72
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:23,242
Okay, that's right. Turn off the gas. Now give

73
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:27,658
that a good mix. Taste that broth white

74
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:31,150
taste for what? Shit in water for two minutes. Where could

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,314
taste? You're just tasting soy sauce and water. Two minutes. Not long enough for

76
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:38,110
anything. Trust me. Uncle Roger know.

77
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,182
Delicious. Plus more salt. Okay, for me.

78
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:44,710
And then a little bit of salt and look,

79
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,034
the seaweed. Seaweed. Now I just cut off.

80
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:51,886
No. What's, uh, he doing?

81
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:54,646
What's he doing? Oh my God.

82
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:57,946
Seaweed into boiling water. What are you

83
00:04:58,008 --> 00:05:01,502
doing? Garden seaweed broth.

84
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:04,380
I'm just going to disintegrate into the water.

85
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,306
You killing me, Gordon. And you're killing the seaweed.

86
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:11,880
Uncle Roger have to put my leg down from chair already.

87
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,950
Gordon, you fucked up. See, we supposed to go in ramen

88
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,858
last thing right before you eat. Like go watch Uncle Roger make

89
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:23,618
ramen with Joe. See how it done. Nice. Long. Sort of almost strip.

90
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:27,214
Like Juliet. No. Uh, every minute this

91
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:30,298
broth is getting better, tastier and

92
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:33,214
deeper. It's getting wrong. Good. Is that what it gets?

93
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:35,760
Vegetables and then just taste again.

94
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,946
Good. Now it's nearly there. Nearly. Uh, where?

95
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:43,150
Hell, that where tofu.

96
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,934
Just literally tofu. Okay, because vegetarian beautiful

97
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:52,486
strands. Not my first choice, but okay, I just place that

98
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:56,242
on top. Wait. Tofu. Straight into what

99
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:59,930
in vegetarian ramen tofu replace the pork belly.

100
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,118
So you need to marinate the tofu first. Don't just

101
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:08,410
serve raw tofu. It just tastes like bean marinade.

102
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,102
Oscar, please come down. Have a quick look at

103
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:16,502
the smorgasbord of delicious ingredients that look just like miso

104
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:20,042
soup. Where co ramen don't look like ramen at all. If your ramen

105
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:23,530
look like miso soup, you fucked up delicious ingredients,

106
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,198
man. That's good. That's so good, man. That's good.

107
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:32,870
He kept tasting and he keep lying. Take your

108
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,690
cephal oil and just sesame oil.

109
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,782
I think, uh, that's going to be the only aroma oil he used.

110
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,554
Sure. The gas is off. I want to touch more spice

111
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:47,570
in there for me. Just a touch. Let it simmer the gap.

112
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,510
This ramen is not jazz. You don't just implement

113
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,126
passes off. Okay? Eggs are boiling

114
00:06:57,318 --> 00:07:00,210
time, please. Right. Three minutes down. Cauliflower.

115
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,746
Cauliflower. Now, this gives a bit of

116
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:07,358
texture for ramen. It's a great way, I guess,

117
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:09,986
for vegetarian ramen flower. Okay,

118
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:14,058
these bits here, just cut around there. Slice those bits

119
00:07:14,094 --> 00:07:17,510
nice and thin. And these stalks are so delicious.

120
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,420
Stock. Delicious. Stock is worst part of vegetable. Um,

121
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:24,750
Uncle Roger don't, um, like vegetable. Vegetables tastes like sad.

122
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,130
But if Uncle Roger has to eat vegetable, I eat the

123
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,938
leaf, because stock tastes as shit. As leaf, but harder

124
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:35,010
to chew. Stock is the same shit food, but more effort.

125
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,694
Who want that? Okay. Like the storks on a broccoli.

126
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:42,374
Beautiful ramen. And put those stalks in

127
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:46,286
there. Uh, take your cauliflower. He's still going

128
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:49,874
on about cauliflower. Lightly season it does

129
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:54,342
that with, uh, some rice flour. Crunch cauliflower.

130
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:56,934
So when we frock on some chili in there. So I got some heat.

131
00:07:57,042 --> 00:08:00,282
Okay? And then look a nice little shallow,

132
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:03,354
fly hot pan. Uh, get the oil

133
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:07,418
in. Nice, crispy texture that sits on top of

134
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:08,330
those noodles.

135
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,374
Is this ramen weejo, or is this cauliflower?

136
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:17,902
With sight of chicken noodleujo. He spent 30 seconds

137
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:21,690
making ramen broth and 3 hours making cauliflower.

138
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,286
All this, uh, time. Meanwhile, the noodle in that pot just drowning

139
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:31,146
again. I love frying a nonstick pan because I

140
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:35,278
get that texture. I really get it nice and soft. Nonstick. You just say nonstick,

141
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,470
and then you use metal spoon.

142
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,630
Cannot use metal spoon in nonstick garden.

143
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,206
Uh, why like this? Uh, today?

144
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:51,098
What's wrong with you? It looked like you came out about getting your shirt

145
00:08:51,134 --> 00:08:53,760
to match the cabinet. They're making good food,

146
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,950
but look. Look at the color of that cauliflower.

147
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,174
Beautiful. Now it's going Golden Brown. Can we

148
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:05,878
go back to ramen now, please? I want a little slice of

149
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:07,800
kitchen towel. Get that ready.

150
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,490
Uh, colander and cauliflower together this week.

151
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,258
Have all of Uncle Roger nightmare. I think it's really nice

152
00:09:16,284 --> 00:09:19,740
and crispy. I've got a chili in there as well.

153
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,446
My mom going to go beat you up. Gordon, scrape, uh, scrape.

154
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:28,406
Scrape with metal spoon. Some wonderful spring

155
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:32,722
onion. Okay, spring onion. Good. Finally, we done with cauliflower on

156
00:09:32,736 --> 00:09:36,086
the bias, so I go sideway this time. Sideway.

157
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:39,670
Uncle Roger likes sideways also, and the sort of

158
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,442
white parts. Again, I'm just going to sprinkle in. Oh, you sprinkle

159
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:47,030
into broth. Spring onion and ramen broth.

160
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,650
Okay, but you're not going to have enough time to get the

161
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,670
flavor out. Ten minutes. One more final taste.

162
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,760
Look at it in there. Oscar, come in, come in. Pan down.

163
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,934
Don't tell Oscar to pan down. Uncle Roger want

164
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:06,790
you to put your pan down. Stop cooking.

165
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,318
That is so delicious. Now, eggs.

166
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:14,582
Take them out. I always like to sort of put them into cold waterfall.

167
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:16,954
Ok, correct. Egg and ice bath. Correct.

168
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:21,086
Right. Time to serve. Get your, uh, bowl. This is a very generous

169
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:24,855
sort of family style dish. Family style. Um,

170
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:29,450
high. But they eat ramen family style. Wrong bowl.

171
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,050
Okay. Big, deep,

172
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,098
beautiful dish now. Oh,

173
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:37,320
look at it. Oh, my God.

174
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,520
The flavor don't look good.

175
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,990
That ramen looks so dead and lifeless.

176
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,902
90 seconds where I forget this. Look.

177
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:55,838
It's so weird serving in this la Crusi sauce panhai.

178
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:59,642
Gordon, just buy ramen bowl. You cannot afford ramen bowl,

179
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:03,382
is it? Your daughter on Strictly Come Dancing? Ask her to lend you some money.

180
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:07,318
Buy some ramen Bowl Tilly, help your old guy out. Go pick up

181
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:10,346
ginger mascallions, spring onions,

182
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:13,942
and then look this beautiful, nice,

183
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:17,614
crispy cauliflower on top. I think this

184
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:21,430
Witcher Gordon, sponsored by cauliflower company. He spent so much

185
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,602
time talking about it. Now with the egg tap, tap, tap,

186
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:27,300
pull. And then just put in your top of your hand.

187
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,306
Don't blow. You're giving everybody a cold

188
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:37,298
with don't blow egg. And that from

189
00:11:37,324 --> 00:11:41,222
there. Literally should come off super quick.

190
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:45,100
Okay, the Ed peeling quite popular. May I give you that

191
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,754
runny yoke and then look. Yoke. Correct. It looked

192
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,986
good, but you need to marinate your egg. Gordon,

193
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:57,134
look at this egg. It's, uh, whiter than Jamie Oliver. Who wants to eat just

194
00:11:57,172 --> 00:12:00,474
from there? Just literally snip snip.

195
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:03,090
That is not fresh. Cilantro. Coriander.

196
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:10,342
No coriander

197
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:11,430
on ramen.

198
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,218
Just because a dish Asian doesn't mean you can just put

199
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:21,298
coriander on it. Some ramen. Chefs put coriander or

200
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:25,018
cilantro in ramen, but not like that. It doesn't matter what country you're in.

201
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:27,900
It's all delicious. And there we are.

202
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,070
What's this? Uncle Roger can't watch anymore.

203
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,958
The broth all wrong. No Tari, barely any aroma

204
00:12:38,994 --> 00:12:42,675
oil. Wrong type of noodle. I know this,

205
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:46,262
uh, is supposed to be quick. Ten minute ramen. But if you want ramen in

206
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:49,898
ten minutes, just make instant ramen even that better than this.

207
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:52,778
Or go to ramen restaurant. Get ramen in ten minutes.

208
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:56,018
Easy. Gordon, your egg spirit rice so good. Why are

209
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:59,694
ramen so bad? Uncle Roger cannot call you Uncle Gordon anymore.

210
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:03,458
I need to take back that title. Gordon, you're supposed to be one of

211
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:10,242
the good ones. Why you join dark site to

212
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,266
all of you. Thank you for watching Ramsay Intent. If I went too quick.

213
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:16,818
Oh, he changed shirt. Slow it down. Now don't forget to pick

214
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:20,614
up Ramsey. Uh, Intent cookbook inspired. Buy this. He got cookbook.

215
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:23,790
Trust me. You want to come out of much better chef. It's going to teach

216
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,690
all wrong recipes. Is it? Why are you going to use that cleaner for

217
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,770
Bok Choy?

218
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,450
Uncle, you have to change color. I too upset.

219
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,610
Good. Now it's nearly there. Nearly where?

220
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,858
Hell. That way. By the

221
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:50,570
way, Uncle Roger noticed what is white people obsession

222
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,230
with making food fast? Like this one?

223
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,530
Ramen in ten minutes. Or Jamie olive oil. Cookbook, like,

224
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,098
five ingredients. Just make it properly?

225
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:03,910
Teaching cooking in Asia, uncle Roger never see anyone go oh

226
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,406
I teach you how to make laksa in nine in it. No it's

227
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:08,080
not going to be good.
