Last time Gordon Ramsey makes a spy. Rice so good. Uncle Roger called him Uncle Gordon. This time he begged me. King Ramen. Can he keep his uncle title, or is he going to lose it? Let's see. Let's see. Halloween and nephew new neon sign. Uncle Roger Rice cooker. What do you think? What you think? Leave comment. Let Uncle Roger know what you think of my neon light underneath the neon light. Wait, before we even start, why Gordon looks so shiny. What is this, medium to saw bullshit? Right? Come on. Let's be honest, ramen, is that comfort food that we all love, especially on a cold day? But today, trust me, I'm going to show you how to elevate that notoriously cheap dish into something delicious. And guess what? Give me a V. That's right. Vegetarian. Right. What making vegetarian food? Cotton. I thought you hate vegetarian. I'm allergic to vegetarians. I come out in a rash. Why you make vegetarian food now? Garden. Why you bow down to those people? What's the point of having all those knives back there if you're vegetarian? Were you gonna use the clever for Pok Choy? Um, and guess what? Give me a V. But give me a we is actually good pickup line. He's a nephew. Go to bar, find woman you like, and tell her to give you a wee. Sorry, children. Right. Come in, Oscar. Let me show you the ingredients. Egg noodles. Egg noodle, uncle Gordon already made mistake. Egg noodle. Raw noodles. Ramen should use wheat alkaline noodles. That's not starting well. Three and a half minutes. Beautiful. Seaweed scallion. Seaweed good scallion tofu correct. Ginger. Good cauliflower. These are the secret ingredients. These are cauliflower, uh, dried shiitake mushrooms. They're going to go in good. And they're going to rehydrate. Right. Let's have ten minutes on the clock. Wait. Ramen take at least 10 hours. He's making in ten minutes. I don't think this is going to go well. Keep watching. See if Uncle Roger correct. Get them with a spoon and drop them into that water. Okay? Please tell me six minutes. Six minutes. Correct. Bring it up to the boil. Boil them gently, and I want to ball that. Put a little bit of sort of yolky bit in the middle. Good. Software immediately. Okay. In mushroom in water. Sort of go up a level. Okay. I hope he making Tara and not just working everything in pan. Turn, uh, the gas up. Okay. And now we're going to start creating that base. First off, a tablespoon of Meat's paste. No, don't put miso paste in your boiling water. It's going to kill the miso. You want to make miso? Make misotari separately. Hi. This, uh, is the same mistake Nigel I lost on making her ramen. Gordon, you make me so sad. Okay, and give that a really good mix. Now, those mushrooms are doubling in size. Doubling in size. Just like Aunty Herald after our marriage. And the exciting thing now is that it starts and give flavor. That water. Wait, just one tablespoon miso in that big pot water. What's the point? Not going to taste like anything. This just Husky hit of miso. That not enough. A Husky hit of miso from there. Tablespoon of soy. Now you're just working random shit in boiling water. Touch a mirror because it gives it a little bit of lift and a bit of a bite. One of my favorites, takarashi spice. Beautiful Japanese pepper in lightly seasoning with the chili flakes. White chili flakes and Takarushi pepper. Same thing. You're wasting money and wasting time. Get your egg noodles in and then. No, don't put your egg noodle wrong. Noodle. First of all. And don't put your noodle in the broth. You should Cook separately. The broth needs time to extract flavor out of ingredients. You put no doubt in broth for that long, it's going to be Socky and dead in the anxiety. Caught, uh uh, on every step. Wrong so far. What happening? What's happening? The gas. Okay, that's right. Turn off the gas. Now give that a good mix. Taste that broth white taste for what? Shit in water for two minutes. Where could taste? You're just tasting soy sauce and water. Two minutes. Not long enough for anything. Trust me. Uncle Roger know. Delicious. Plus more salt. Okay, for me. And then a little bit of salt and look, the seaweed. Seaweed. Now I just cut off. No. What's, uh, he doing? What's he doing? Oh my God. Seaweed into boiling water. What are you doing? Garden seaweed broth. I'm just going to disintegrate into the water. You killing me, Gordon. And you're killing the seaweed. Uncle Roger have to put my leg down from chair already. Gordon, you fucked up. See, we supposed to go in ramen last thing right before you eat. Like go watch Uncle Roger make ramen with Joe. See how it done. Nice. Long. Sort of almost strip. Like Juliet. No. Uh, every minute this broth is getting better, tastier and deeper. It's getting wrong. Good. Is that what it gets? Vegetables and then just taste again. Good. Now it's nearly there. Nearly. Uh, where? Hell, that where tofu. Just literally tofu. Okay, because vegetarian beautiful strands. Not my first choice, but okay, I just place that on top. Wait. Tofu. Straight into what in vegetarian ramen tofu replace the pork belly. So you need to marinate the tofu first. Don't just serve raw tofu. It just tastes like bean marinade. Oscar, please come down. Have a quick look at the smorgasbord of delicious ingredients that look just like miso soup. Where co ramen don't look like ramen at all. If your ramen look like miso soup, you fucked up delicious ingredients, man. That's good. That's so good, man. That's good. He kept tasting and he keep lying. Take your cephal oil and just sesame oil. I think, uh, that's going to be the only aroma oil he used. Sure. The gas is off. I want to touch more spice in there for me. Just a touch. Let it simmer the gap. This ramen is not jazz. You don't just implement passes off. Okay? Eggs are boiling time, please. Right. Three minutes down. Cauliflower. Cauliflower. Now, this gives a bit of texture for ramen. It's a great way, I guess, for vegetarian ramen flower. Okay, these bits here, just cut around there. Slice those bits nice and thin. And these stalks are so delicious. Stock. Delicious. Stock is worst part of vegetable. Um, Uncle Roger don't, um, like vegetable. Vegetables tastes like sad. But if Uncle Roger has to eat vegetable, I eat the leaf, because stock tastes as shit. As leaf, but harder to chew. Stock is the same shit food, but more effort. Who want that? Okay. Like the storks on a broccoli. Beautiful ramen. And put those stalks in there. Uh, take your cauliflower. He's still going on about cauliflower. Lightly season it does that with, uh, some rice flour. Crunch cauliflower. So when we frock on some chili in there. So I got some heat. Okay? And then look a nice little shallow, fly hot pan. Uh, get the oil in. Nice, crispy texture that sits on top of those noodles. Is this ramen weejo, or is this cauliflower? With sight of chicken noodleujo. He spent 30 seconds making ramen broth and 3 hours making cauliflower. All this, uh, time. Meanwhile, the noodle in that pot just drowning again. I love frying a nonstick pan because I get that texture. I really get it nice and soft. Nonstick. You just say nonstick, and then you use metal spoon. Cannot use metal spoon in nonstick garden. Uh, why like this? Uh, today? What's wrong with you? It looked like you came out about getting your shirt to match the cabinet. They're making good food, but look. Look at the color of that cauliflower. Beautiful. Now it's going Golden Brown. Can we go back to ramen now, please? I want a little slice of kitchen towel. Get that ready. Uh, colander and cauliflower together this week. Have all of Uncle Roger nightmare. I think it's really nice and crispy. I've got a chili in there as well. My mom going to go beat you up. Gordon, scrape, uh, scrape. Scrape with metal spoon. Some wonderful spring onion. Okay, spring onion. Good. Finally, we done with cauliflower on the bias, so I go sideway this time. Sideway. Uncle Roger likes sideways also, and the sort of white parts. Again, I'm just going to sprinkle in. Oh, you sprinkle into broth. Spring onion and ramen broth. Okay, but you're not going to have enough time to get the flavor out. Ten minutes. One more final taste. Look at it in there. Oscar, come in, come in. Pan down. Don't tell Oscar to pan down. Uncle Roger want you to put your pan down. Stop cooking. That is so delicious. Now, eggs. Take them out. I always like to sort of put them into cold waterfall. Ok, correct. Egg and ice bath. Correct. Right. Time to serve. Get your, uh, bowl. This is a very generous sort of family style dish. Family style. Um, high. But they eat ramen family style. Wrong bowl. Okay. Big, deep, beautiful dish now. Oh, look at it. Oh, my God. The flavor don't look good. That ramen looks so dead and lifeless. 90 seconds where I forget this. Look. It's so weird serving in this la Crusi sauce panhai. Gordon, just buy ramen bowl. You cannot afford ramen bowl, is it? Your daughter on Strictly Come Dancing? Ask her to lend you some money. Buy some ramen Bowl Tilly, help your old guy out. Go pick up ginger mascallions, spring onions, and then look this beautiful, nice, crispy cauliflower on top. I think this Witcher Gordon, sponsored by cauliflower company. He spent so much time talking about it. Now with the egg tap, tap, tap, pull. And then just put in your top of your hand. Don't blow. You're giving everybody a cold with don't blow egg. And that from there. Literally should come off super quick. Okay, the Ed peeling quite popular. May I give you that runny yoke and then look. Yoke. Correct. It looked good, but you need to marinate your egg. Gordon, look at this egg. It's, uh, whiter than Jamie Oliver. Who wants to eat just from there? Just literally snip snip. That is not fresh. Cilantro. Coriander. No coriander on ramen. Just because a dish Asian doesn't mean you can just put coriander on it. Some ramen. Chefs put coriander or cilantro in ramen, but not like that. It doesn't matter what country you're in. It's all delicious. And there we are. What's this? Uncle Roger can't watch anymore. The broth all wrong. No Tari, barely any aroma oil. Wrong type of noodle. I know this, uh, is supposed to be quick. Ten minute ramen. But if you want ramen in ten minutes, just make instant ramen even that better than this. Or go to ramen restaurant. Get ramen in ten minutes. Easy. Gordon, your egg spirit rice so good. Why are ramen so bad? Uncle Roger cannot call you Uncle Gordon anymore. I need to take back that title. Gordon, you're supposed to be one of the good ones. Why you join dark site to all of you. Thank you for watching Ramsay Intent. If I went too quick. Oh, he changed shirt. Slow it down. Now don't forget to pick up Ramsey. Uh, Intent cookbook inspired. Buy this. He got cookbook. Trust me. You want to come out of much better chef. It's going to teach all wrong recipes. Is it? Why are you going to use that cleaner for Bok Choy? Uncle, you have to change color. I too upset. Good. Now it's nearly there. Nearly where? Hell. That way. By the way, Uncle Roger noticed what is white people obsession with making food fast? Like this one? Ramen in ten minutes. Or Jamie olive oil. Cookbook, like, five ingredients. Just make it properly? Teaching cooking in Asia, uncle Roger never see anyone go oh I teach you how to make laksa in nine in it. No it's not going to be good.
